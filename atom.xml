    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://shedcode.github.com/jamesjefferies-photo.jpg" width="200" height="200" title="James Jefferies" > Hi, I&#8217;m <a href="http://jamesjefferies.com">James Jefferies</a>, a Software Engineer &amp; Technologist. I formed ShedCode in the Summer of 2011 to work on interesting projects with interesting people.</p>

<p>After many years of being an employee for large companies, solving problems by thinking hard &amp; asking computers to help, I wanted to be more flexibile with who I could work with.</p>

<p>I love to fix all kinds of problems, from building bespoke web, desktop &amp; mobile applications to streamlining your business processes. I can&#8217;t do everything though, so I often work in conjunction with experts who I have worked with over the years. From User Experience designers, to System Technicicans, to Project Managers, to Testers, never mind the Developers and Software Engineers!</p>
