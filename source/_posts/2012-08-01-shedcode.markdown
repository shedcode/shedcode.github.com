{% img left /images/jamesjefferies-photo.jpg 200 200 James Jefferies  %} Hi, I'm [James Jefferies](http://jamesjefferies.com), a Software Engineer & Technologist. I formed ShedCode in the Summer of 2011 to work on interesting projects with interesting people. 

After many years of being an employee for large companies, solving problems by thinking hard & asking computers to help, I wanted to be more flexible with who I could work with & what I worked on.

I love to fix all kinds of problems, from building bespoke web, desktop & mobile applications, performance consultancy, architecture and general technical advice. 

Sometimes I work on my own, or with a client's team. Other times, I am able to team up with some of the experts I've worked with over the years. From User Experience designers, to System Technicians, to Project Managers and Testers to provide a full solution.

## Current Project Highlights

* [Steam powered Arduino](http://jamesjefferies.com/2012/11/11/steam-powered-arduino-part-1/)
* Finance Portal - web application enabling statements and payements for a client
* Roster - speed dating for railway engines
