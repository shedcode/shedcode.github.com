We formed the company in the Summer of 2011 to work on interesting projects with interesting people. After many years of solving problems by thinking hard & asking computers to help we wanted to be more flexible with who we could work with. We love to fix all kinds of problems, from building bespoke web, desktop & mobile applications to streamlining your business processes. Sometimes we work in conjunction with other companies and agencies to ensure you get what you need with the best advice possible.

## The People
