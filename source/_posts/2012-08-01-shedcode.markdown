{% img left /images/jamesjefferies-photo.jpg 200 200 James Jefferies  %} Hi, I'm [James Jefferies](http://jamesjefferies.com), a Software Engineer & Technologist. I formed ShedCode in the Summer of 2011 to work on interesting projects with interesting people. 

After many years of being an employee for large companies, solving problems by thinking hard & asking computers to help, I wanted to be more flexible with who I could work with.

I love to fix all kinds of problems, from building bespoke web, desktop & mobile applications to streamlining your business processes. I can't do everything though, so I often work in conjunction with experts who I have worked with over the years. From User Experience designers, to System Technicians, to Project Managers, to Testers, never mind the Developers and Software Engineers!
