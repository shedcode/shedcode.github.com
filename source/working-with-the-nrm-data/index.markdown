## Introduction

For the "Off The Rails" hackday, we've been fortunate to get access to some of the National Railway Museum data. This data is in various forms, a lot of it having been catalogued over the last 15 years or so. Thanks to Mark Green of the NRM for sorting out access and to Rachel Coldicutt for putting us in touch.

## NMSI data

These data sets contain information about objects from the collections of the Science Museum, the National Media Museum and the National Railway Museum. Itâ€™s likely to be a bit out of date, but still useful. The data is all in large csv formatted files.

It is released under a CC BY-NC-SA license

### Archive Lists (with license) 

The drawing lists from this page are released under a CC0 licence 


There is a whole lot of data here, including a combination of Access databases (mdb), Word Documents and Excel spreadsheets. They're all available as a [zip file](http://nrm.org.uk/survey/nrm_railwaycodrawinglists.zip)

This data is somewhat messy and inconsistent. Most of the Access DBs open in a Reports view, but Tables is where the interesting stuff is. 

The guides to this data which explain some of the idiosyncrasies and acronyms/abbreviations that the lists use.

### Archive Lists (no license at present)

This data has only recently been added. The data is somewhat inconsistent and takes the form of PDFs or Word Docs. We also have these in a more, err, raw format, Access db mdb files. 

[Archive](http://www.nrm.org.uk/ResearchAndArchive/archiveandlibrarycollections)

The NRM would be interested to see if anyone could get these data sets in to a more friendly, usable, interesting format.

###Archive Drawings (no license)

These drawings match up with the lists in the archive, however they are not linked on the website.
